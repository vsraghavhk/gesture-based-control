# Controlling UAV camera using gestures with Leap Motion Controller

This project was an extension to CSCE 635 AI Robotics with Dr. Robin Murphy at Texas A&M. 
Project developed by [Raghav Hari Krishna](https://github.com/vsraghavhk) and [Leslie Kim](), developed during Fall of 2020. 

The final report for this project which explains the prohject in detail, is available [here]. 

## Requirements
This project requires the following softwares and SDKs for the corresponding hardware. 

### [Leap Motion Controller](https://www.ultraleap.com/product/leap-motion-controller/): 
  - [Leap Motion SDK Version 3.2](https://developer.leapmotion.com/releases/leap-motion-orion-321)
  - [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
  The documentation to use the Leap Motion SDK with Python 2.7 can be found [here](https://developer-archive.leapmotion.com/documentation/python/index.html#). 
The Leap Motion SDK does not officially support Python 3 and above. But there are a few wrappers made by the community, but they do not tend to work. 
Let me know if you come across a working one. 
  
### [Parrot Anafi Thermal drone](https://www.parrot.com/us/drones/anafi-thermal)
  - [PyParrot API](https://github.com/amymcgovern/pyparrot) by [amymcgovern](https://github.com/amymcgovern)
  - [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)
